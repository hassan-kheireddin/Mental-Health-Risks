Great point — while the housing price prediction project is solid for learning, it's very common  in beginner portfolios. To stand out, you’ll want a unique and impactful project  that not only shows technical skill but also creativity, domain interest , and real-world relevance . 

Here’s a less popular but highly impressive supervised ML project idea : 
🚀 Project Idea: "Predictive Mental Health Screening Using Survey Data"  
🎯 Objective: 

Build a model that predicts whether a person may be at risk of mental health issues (like depression or anxiety) using survey responses and behavioral data. 
🔧 Why It Stands Out: 

    Taps into an important and growing domain: mental health tech .
    Combines logistic regression  (for classification), feature importance analysis , and interpretability —key skills in healthcare/AI.
    Can use real-world or synthetic datasets with rich features like sleep patterns, work stress, social habits, etc.
     

📊 Dataset Ideas: 

    Use the NHANES (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey)  dataset Or create your own mock survey data with Likert-scale questions on:
        Sleep quality
        Work-life balance
        Stress levels
        Social interaction frequency
        Physical activity
         
     

You can simulate labels like “Likely Depressed” or “Not Likely” based on scoring rules. 
🧠 Model Implementation: 

    Logistic Regression  – Predict binary outcome (At-risk / Not at-risk).
    Regularization (L1/L2)  – To handle sparse or noisy features.
    Interpret Coefficients  – Explain which factors most influence mental health risk.
    Optional: Add polynomial features  to capture non-linear effects (e.g., stress × sleep quality).
     

📈 Extra Features to Add: 

    A web interface  (Flask/Dash) where users input their responses and get predictions.
    An explainer dashboard  showing feature impact on risk score.
    Export results as a downloadable PDF report.
     

✅ Portfolio Benefits: 

    Shows empathy and interest in health-tech  or AI for social good .
    Highlights data interpretation , not just modeling.
    Can be extended into more advanced models later (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost).
    Unique enough to stand out from typical housing/iris projects
